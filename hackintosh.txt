#if (OS X > 10.6)
#Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite and Sierra
#1. reboot pc and press 'cmd + r'
#2. menu bar -> Utilities -> Terminal -> resetpassword

#else if (OS X < 10.6)
#1. reboot pc and press 'cmd + s'
#Now there are two methos:
#Method1 is simple and fast (try this one first)
#Method2 is a bit tricky and lasts alot longer because it is a whole mac setup

#Method1:
#2. write following commands and replace 'username' with the username and 'password' with the password

mount -uw /   #give access to the actual drive
launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist
ls /Users
dscl . -passwd /Users/username password  #resets the 'password' at 'username'
reboot

#Method2:
#2. write the following commands then the mac will think he is completly new -> u can sett a new admin acc
# and with the new admin account you can change the password of the old account still existing on the machine
# for more informations about how to proceed after resetting the computer watch this video:
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjxAgiNqkDM

mount -uw /          #permissions
rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone  #delete the setup information -> the pc thinks he is completly new

shutdown -h now #shutdown to "save"
#or better reboot
reboot
